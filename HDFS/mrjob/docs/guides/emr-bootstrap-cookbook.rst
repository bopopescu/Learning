 EMR Bootstrapping Cookbook
============================

Bootstrapping allows you to run commands to customize EMR machines, at the
time the cluster is created.

When to use bootstrap, and when to use setup
============================================

You can use :mrjob-opt:`bootstrap` and :mrjob-opt:`setup` together.

Generally, you want to use :mrjob-opt:`bootstrap` for things that are
part of your general production environment, and :mrjob-opt:`setup`
for things that are specific to your particular job. This makes things
work as expected if you are using :ref:`cluster-pooling`.

All these examples use :mrjob-opt:`bootstrap`. Not saying it's a good idea, but
all these examples will work with :mrjob-opt:`setup` as well (yes, Hadoop
tasks on EMR apparently have access to :command:`sudo`).


.. _using-pip:

Installing Python packages with pip
===================================

The only tricky thing is making sure you install packages for the correct
version of Python.

.. _installing-ujson:

Figure out which version of Python you'll be running on EMR (see
:mrjob-opt:`python_bin` for defaults).

 * If it's Python 2, use :command:`pip2.7` (just plain :command:`pip` also
   works on AMI 4.3.0 and later)
 * If it's Python 3, use :command:`pip-3.4`

For example, to install :py:mod:`ujson` on Python 2:

.. code-block:: yaml

    runners:
      emr:
        bootstrap:
        - sudo pip-2.7 install ujson

See `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ for a the full list of available
Python packages.

You can also install packages from a `requirements <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files>`__ file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    runners:
      emr:
        bootstrap:
        - sudo pip-2.7 install -r /local/path/of/requirements.txt#

Or a tarball:

.. code-block:: yaml

    runners:
      emr:
        bootstrap:
        - sudo pip-2.7 install /local/path/of/tarball.tar.gz#

.. warning::

   If you're trying to run jobs on AMI version 3.0.0 (protip: don't do that)
   :command:`pip` appears not to work due to out-of-date SSL
   certificate information.


.. _installing-packages:

Installing System Packages
==========================

EMR gives you access to a variety of different Amazon Machine Images, or AMIs
for short (see :mrjob-opt:`image_version`).

3.x and 4.x AMIs
----------------

Starting with 3.0.0, EMR AMIs use Amazon Linux, which uses :command:`yum` to
install packages. For example, to install NumPy:

.. code-block:: yaml

    runners:
      emr:
        bootstrap:
        - sudo yum install -y python27-numpy

(Don't forget the ``-y``!)

Amazon Linux currently has few packages for Python 3 libraries; if you're
on Python 3, just :ref:`use pip <using-pip>`.

Here are the package lists for all the various versions of Amazon Linux used
by EMR:

 * `2015.09 <http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2015.09-packages/>`__ (3.11.0 and 4.2.0-4.4.0)
 * `2015.03 <http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2015.03-packages/>`__ (3.7.0-3.10.0 and 4.0.0-4.1.0)
 * `2014.09 <http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2014.09-packages/>`__ (3.4.0-3.6.0)
 * `2014.03 <http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2014.03-packages/>`__ (3.1.0-3.3.2)
 * `2013.09 <http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2013.09-packages/>`__ (3.0.0-3.0.4)

.. note::

   The package lists gloss over Python versions; wherever you see a package
   named ``python-<lib name>``, you'll want to install ``python26-<lib name>``
   or ``python27-<lib name>`` instead.

2.x AMIs
--------

Probably not worth the trouble. The 2.x AMIs are based on a version of Debian
that is so old it has been "archived," which makes their package installer,
:command:`apt-get`, no longer work out-of-the-box. Moreover, Python system
packages work for Python 2.6, not 2.7.

Instead, just use :command:`pip-2.7` to install Python libraries.

.. _installing-python-from-source:

Installing Python from source
=============================

If you really must use a version of Python that's not available on EMR
(e.g. Python 3.5 or a very specific patch version), you can
download and compile Python from source.

.. note::

   This adds an extra 5 to 10 minutes before the cluster can run your job.

Here's how you download and install a Python tarball:

.. code-block:: yaml

    runners:
      emr:
        bootstrap:
        - wget -S -T 10 -t 5 https://www.python.org/ftp/python/x.y.z/Python-x.y.z.tgz
        - tar xfz Python-x.y.z.tgz
        - cd Python-x.y.z; ./configure && make && sudo make install; cd ..
        bootstrap_python: false
        python_bin: /usr/local/bin/python

(Replace ``x.y.z`` with a specific version of Python.)

Python 3.4+ comes with :command:`pip` by default, but earlier versions do not,
so you'll want to tack on ``get-pip.py``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    runners:
      emr:
        bootstrap:
        ...
        - wget -S -T 10 -t 5 https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
        - sudo /usr/local/bin/python get-pip.py

Also, :command:`pip` will be installed in ``/usr/local/bin``, which is not in
the path for :command:`sudo`, so use its full path:

.. code-block:: yaml

    runners:
      emr:
        bootstrap:
        ...
        - sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install ...
